        how HTML works, how would you make it easy for them to understand? If
        you have some extra time, try your explanation with a friend and tell us
        about it.

      <b>Answer:</b><br />The language used to build web pages is called HTML,
      or HyperText Markup Language. It consists of a collection of tags that are
      employed to specify or mark up the information included inside a web page.
      These tags act as guidelines that inform a web browser how to present the
      material. For example, the tag is used to insert an image into the website
      whereas the tag is used to mark up a paragraph of text. Each tag has a
      particular purpose, and they can be combined in different ways to produce
      a web page.<br /><br />You must use a text editor to generate the HTML
      code and then save the file with the.html extension in order to build an
      HTML web page. When you open the file in a web browser, the browser
      deciphers the HTML code and renders the page as instructed by the tags.
      Consider HTML as a recipe if you want to comprehend it more clearly. HTML
      teaches a web browser on how to display a web page by using tags to
      describe the content, much like a recipe instructs you on how to prepare a
      meal by describing the ingredients and stages.<br /><br />
      To make the concept more tangible and understandable, you may want to
      demonstrate some basic HTML tags and how they're utilized to a friend. For
      instance, you could demonstrate how to create a basic web page with a
      title, heading, and paragraph by utilizing tags like &lt;html&gt;,
      head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, and &lt;p&gt;.
